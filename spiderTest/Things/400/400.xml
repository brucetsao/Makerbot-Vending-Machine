It really might.I ran it through skeinforge and it looks like the teeth in successive sections skew just barely little enough that the one should print on top of the other.  Other than that, the gear obeys the 45 degree rule-of-thumb at least in that the helix's angle is 45 degrees.If anyone successfully prints it, please tell me so I can use it in later projects.</description></thing>
