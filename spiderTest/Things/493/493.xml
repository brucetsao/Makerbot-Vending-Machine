It is in the 45' range.It's one of my first 3D models, so don't expect much of it technically. Still, this might be an interesting printing test!It was made in Wings 3D, an open source modeling tool that actually looks very promising.At different scales this will have different springiness. A derivative could be higher and have more 'windings', but lets first see if this prints :)</description></thing>
