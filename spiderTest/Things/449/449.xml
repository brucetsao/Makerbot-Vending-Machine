It might make a very infuriating teapot, I suppose.The 'bone' variant is the same as the 'skin', but with more visibility inside.To get a good idea of what is going on inside, some of the pictures of the wireframe views of these Things are your best bet.So this answers the question: Yes, we can make a Klein bottle.EDIT: Added an anaglyph image, since this is a confusing shape. Getcher red'n'blue glasses, step right up!</description></thing>
