I'm sure people can do a lot better but maybe someone will be inspired by this.Not sure how feasible printing will be so let me know if you need anything changed. I have the axles so that the bottom should rest on the ground nicely and should print in theory.I have plans to make a wind-up rubber band powered version but no time right now.</description></thing>
