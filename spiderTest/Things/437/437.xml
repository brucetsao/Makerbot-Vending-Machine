(I couldn't get TopMod to quite grip the faces I wanted.)  In addition I sharpened the tops of the holes in the outer brane to make them more printer-friendly.The Double-Brane Mug is heavily influenced by this one:thingiverse.com/thing:434(Topologically speaking mine's an inside-out version!)I've included the last TopMod file before export to Blender for comparison and ease of hacking on it.</description></thing>
