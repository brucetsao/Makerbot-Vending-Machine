Rather than gear-shaped (which has a number of mechanical advantages but which I don't have a script to do all the work for me) the threads are triangle shaped.The nut has been scaled up a few percent laterally, which hopefully will make it work with the bolts.  If these print, it should be possible to do a lot of the things one does with bolts, screws, and nuts, printably.The script parameters to duplicate bolts are:diameter: 10 unitsstep: 2 unitsindent: 1 unitBlender can make bolts and screws of any length with those parameters.  A slightly larger diameter (10.2 or so) with the same step and indent parameters should create nuts, threadings, etc.Edit:Tweaked the screw's tip a bit: I think it probably would have printed in such a way as to not fit to the nut.  (It's possible I haven't fixed the problem that caused the screw cap to fail, but the most obvious problem with that design looks like it wasn't in this model.</description></thing>
