So I took the geodesic generator script and applied it to a dodecahedron instead.Fearing for its printability, I scaled the middle vertices inward almost to a point, which should make those short horizontal jogs at least "printable on a good day" if the stuff I've seen done on the RepRap forums is any indication.  (Of course if you've got one of those printers with support materials print away :3  )The Geodesic Generator script can be found here:wiki.blender.org/index.php/Extensions:Py/Scripts/Manual/Wizards/geodesic_domeAnd while it's not the most user-friendly thing in the world, it works.  For the dodecahedron, things don't quite work perfectly: it generates struts for all three triangles that make up each pentagonal face in my model!  Buuuuut with a few minutes jabbing the delete key, all was well.</description></thing>
