When I made it in Sketchup it was 50x50 mm but when it got converted some of the cylinder got messed up and the size is definately messed up but if one wants to print this just simply change the scale until it is 50x50 mm! I haven't printed it yet because I haven't received my 3-D printer yet! The pegs in the box top are to keep it from spinning around.SKETCHUP RULES!!!!I will make some puzzles during the summer!</description></thing>
