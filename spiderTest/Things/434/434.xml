Same licence, download, modify, print... or do what TMR did and make your own from scratch after you see the tutorial video!EDIT: Added a variant with a flat base and a diamond pattern in the filigree, as per Zach's suggestions. It should print more cleanly.EDIT: It slices in Skeinforge, and it prints on a MakerBot. Screenshot added.</description></thing>
