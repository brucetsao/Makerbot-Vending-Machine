<thing><id>426</id><title>Pendant (Hand of Prometheus)</title><author>MaskedRetriever</author><description>A little bit of ancient iconography on my part, the Hand of Prometheus is my symbolic way of representing the story in Greek mythology where Prometheus steals fire from the gods and gives it to mankind.This story shows up in a lot of references to science and technology, especially in the context of humanity attaining powers over things previously reserved for nature, like fire, flight, and in the case of Mary Shelly's tale of "The Modern Prometheus" life itself.I tend to present this icon in a *heroic* context, since I am in favor of greater human power over time, and hope that as we do get more powerful, we'll also get smarter fast enough that we don't destroy ourselves.Bonus: Obeying the 45-degree rule on this piece has resulted in a little echo of the RepRap logo in the loop for the chain to run through.</description></thing>
