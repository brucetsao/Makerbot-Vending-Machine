This version is only 8cm long.Note:Skeinforge didn't like the first version of this because the Array Modifier in Blender left behind about a hundred stray internal edges!  I corrected this by manually deleting them (not *quite* as tedious as it sounds but close) but in future I'm going to be on the lookout for a better way to manifold-ize objects that have been array-ified this way...</description></thing>
