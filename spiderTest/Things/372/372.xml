<thing><id>372</id><title>Dice Pack</title><author>MaskedRetriever</author><description>Hacked up in Blender-- I apparently couldn't resist quickly putting together some Platonic solids and the "bastard die", despite not having a way to print them at present.EDIT: I found a great script for platonic solids here:selleri.org/Blender/scripts/text.htmlSo the d8 and d4 are now perfect Platonic solids, and I have a d12 in this pack now.Copyright notice: these shapes have been in the public domain since 300 BC or so.  I have not changed this.</description></thing>
