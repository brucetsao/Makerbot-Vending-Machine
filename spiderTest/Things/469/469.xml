You have to glue it together, and it is fairly delicate in transit.  This is sort of crappy, so I set out to see if it could be printed.  The answer:  yes.  Yes, it can.The technique I used was:1. Design the profile in QCad to get it nice and accurate (sorry, blender's 2D CAD sucks!  Snapping is crucial)2. Import DXF into Blender3. Select all, join object4. 'Spin' around axis.5. Win!</description></thing>
