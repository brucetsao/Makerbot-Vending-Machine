GURPS players rejoice!After I made the Mountain Game board demo I decided to do something for the more formal gamers out there.  These hex tiles interlock, so that each nine-hex building block can be hooked in a fairly sturdy fashion to the others, forming an arbitrary-size game board for pretty much pocket change.In addition to standard hex slabs (what would be the fun of something you could do with paper, right?), the 3D print aspect of the hex tiles lets them be extruded to create arbitrary height fields (demoed in the hill pieces, but extensible to just about ANYTHING) and the wall pieces included can be used to build arbitrary structures.And naturally, this is only the beginning!  With the implemented "software standard hex" shapes, figurine bases, stackable landscape add-ons, and virtually anything you can extrude out of or union onto the base plates can become part of the game pieces.Game on!I've taken the commercial restriction off this one for a reason-- I want to see people SELLING these, and if all I get is my name on the box, I'll be a happy camper!</description></thing>
