But if you run it at its highest current (near to the maximum of 2A) the driver chip will get pretty hot.The fan mount will allow you to attach an ordinary 12v CPU fan (34mm hole centres) to the stepper driver board to cool the driver chip.  If you want you can use heatsink compound to stick a small SMT-type heatsink to the top of the chip to improve cooling even further.</description></thing>
