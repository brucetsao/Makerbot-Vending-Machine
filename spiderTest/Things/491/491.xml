It is by no means finished but it is a start.It has a turntable  driven by a motor ( a size I had in my 'bits' box ) and mounts for a camera and the laser line drawer.It needs heaps more work but I thought I'd put the first cut into the thingiverse and see what people came up withThe blender file of the complete device is included in the tar gzip file. I have not uploaded all the stl files individually , grab the zip if you want them all.To build it you will need a 608 bearing , 5mm (or 3/8 ) rod , some M4-20 bolts , a motor , webcam , laser pointer and possibly a PHD in quantum physics :PThere is no software yet but thissjbaker.org/wiki/index.php?title=A_Simple_3D_Scannerlooks like a good start; combined with an arduino to index the wheel and some scripting this could be a automatic scanner.</description></thing>
