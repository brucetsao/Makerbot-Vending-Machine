I had to cut the wing into two pieces, chord-wise, but I think it should be a lot easier to print this way... and securing the two halves shouldn't be a major undertaking. Anyone up for making a tab-and-slot version?Comments welcome, as always, and feel free to re-use the blender files to make your own variations on this.
