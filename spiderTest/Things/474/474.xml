This is horrible, and the only excuse I have to offer is that 300dpi is in Imperial units, meaning that when I try to zoom in to the millimeter scale horrible things happen.  Eventually I'll have to make some sort of DXF or something with proper markings.  If you come up with one before I do, let me know in the comments and I'll include it.I don't have the negative-clip side of the calipers put in because in all the orientations I could figure it resulted in things that needed supports.  For now I think I'll leave it, and if I either come up with a way to avoid supports for the neg side or decide supports are acceptable, I'll alter it.</description></thing>
