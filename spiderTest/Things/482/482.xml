Should work well with anything conical/column-like, including, say, wings!EDIT: I made a wing using this technique, which I've take to calling Flat-Roll... Here it is:thingiverse.com/thing:483(I kinda forgot to make it a derivative of this one, not used to that feature working again)This rests on the notion (or hope?) that if you print something sufficiently thin, it will bend without snapping. (Might need to heat the piece?) If this is true, you can split your 3D shape into flat sections and unroll it, print it, and then roll it back up.This may not be the best way to do this, but I connected each section in this first experiment with just a face, no thickness... I'm hoping Skeinforge will automatically print that with the thinnest layer it can, but I don't really know.EDIT2: Nophead returned some experience and pointed out that zero-thickness faces won't print at all. Luckily, this is easily fixable since that big, flat underside is easily adjustable with a push-pull or extrude command in most CAD programs. Here's a variation that shows this:thingiverse.com/thing:485EDIT3: Jay Swift pointed out that you could print this out onto a sheet of flexible plastic without adjusting the thickness at all. You would then trim the sheet prior to rolling the whole thing up.If this is workable, future improvements would include centering pins on the contact faces between each section... perhaps even some kind of latching mechanism.</description></thing>
