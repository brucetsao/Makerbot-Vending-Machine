This is a case for a simple 9v flashlight that uses a 9v battery, two 5mm LED's, a resistor, and a switch. It uses a snap joint to join the two parts.I'm not good with blender at all so I did it with Autodesk Inventor. You'll probably have to play with the orientation and stuff so that it will be printable.--EDIT--I removed the snap joint because I found it wasn't very printable (at least the way I had it) so the top just fits quite snugly on the bottom.</description></thing>
