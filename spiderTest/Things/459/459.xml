<thing><id>459</id><title>Printable Robot (sort of)</title><author>MaskedRetriever</author><description>The main body *barely* fits in the CupCake build area-- I had to rotate it 45 degrees to squeeze it in.This bot can be assembled from some pretty common items, standard servos, 6xAA battery pack and an Arduino.  (See the second shape pack.)  It's not really a "printable robot" in the sense that I'm still requiring pretty complex parts (even making the common "circuit exception" used by the RepRap foundation in their builds), BUT there's no custom machining to do once you print the parts out.  Just print 'em, slap on the mail-order parts and you've got a bot.You'll also need screws and nuts to hold things together, at whatever size works for your area.  I'm using 4-40 screws but anything that'll fit a 3-mm diameter hole will do.</description></thing>
