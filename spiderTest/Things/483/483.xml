<thing><id>483</id><title>FlatRoll Airfoil</title><author>syvwlch</author><description>An application of the design concept behind the Heptagonal Column (thingiverse.com/thing:482) to a standard Clark Y airfoil.Like the column, this assumes that Skeinforge will print the zero thickness faces with enough flexibility to support bending/folding there. This is an experiment and I would be surprised if some adjustments weren't required...EDIT: Nophead pointed out that, in fact, zero thickness faces don't print out. Luckily, this is easily fixable since the big, flat underside can be adjusted handily with a push-pull or extrude command in most CAD programs. Here's an example of that:thingiverse.com/thing:485EDIT2: Jay Swift had a brainwave and pointed out that you could print this out on a flexible sheet of plastic. This is brilliant, because the sheet would replace the zero thickness face on the bottom. You would just have to trim the sheet before you rolled it up.</description></thing>
