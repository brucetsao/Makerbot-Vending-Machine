thingSpider.py is a thingiverse crawler.  It iterates across all the things in thingiverse, checking to see if 
the thing is 3D print-able.  If it is, it creates a folder with the thing's id number, downloads all images from the image
gallery and all stl files from the thing's parts.  It also generates an stl file with the thing's name, the author,
and the thing's description
