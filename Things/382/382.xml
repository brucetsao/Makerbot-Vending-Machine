This hasn't been printed out before.For use with the Mabuchi DC motors:allelectronics.com/make-a-store/item/DCM-296/SMALL-DC-MOTOR-MABUCHI/1.htmlThere is a 3D model of this motor in the .blend file.Edit!I'm getting reports of gears not meshing at this size from the MakerBot team, and scaling up this design 'till they do puts the frame outside the bounding box.  I've got some ideas, though, so hang in there.  Meanwhile, anyone with good enough resolution to get gears to mesh at this size (or 2x for that matter) should still be able to get this working.Notes on 2.0:Patch! 1.6:The new files have been patched so that all of them slice in Skeinforge without errors or warnings, making this the first version I'd recommend printing without going "eeennnnhhh..." after doing so.  The horns also got a nice upgrade which gives them attractive rounded-off corners.  Still don't have a motor clip though....Notes 1.5:</description></thing>
