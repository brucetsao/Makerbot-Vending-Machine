Everything else should be printable and workable, although of course without a 3D printer of my own I could just be blowing smoke.I'm planning on making a set of "horns" for the output gear-- best idea I've had so far for that is to have the maker glue them on.  I think I can add a clip for the motor, but I'd have to decide on a motor type.  Suggestions?</description></thing>
