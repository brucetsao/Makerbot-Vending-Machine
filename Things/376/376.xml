(What do you really call these?)  With a bit of extruding and squinching, I put a pin on the top and its negative on the underside. I couldn't think of a good way to make a positive pin printable, so I'm hoping putting holes on one side of the gears is mechanically viable.A gear train made of a few of these could give a motor decent oomph, assuming I can bodge together a mechanical framework to support them, the motor, and the wheels.  More bits of this project later.</description></thing>
